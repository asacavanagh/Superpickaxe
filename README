This version of SPA is compatible with Spigot/Craftbukkit for 1.7.2 thus far.

This plugin implements a simple but effective "Super Pickaxe" that destroys all blocks in a single click.
The plugin has similar features to WorldEdit's "//" Super Pick, however this one 
is loggable using LogBlock or bigBrother. It also has an option within its config to override WorldEdits
Super Pickaxe commands. Supports all major permissions plugins including Bukkit's permissions!

Current Default Commands:
Enable/Disable - /spa

Current Permissions (Self Explanitory):
- superpickaxe.use
- superpickaxe.notooldamage
- superpickaxe.breakAll

REQUIREMENTS:
- Bukkit (Latest RB) - http://dl.bukkit.org/downloads/craftbukkit/list/rb/
- WorldEdit - http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/worldedit/
- LogBlock - http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/logblock/

Please note the following:

- The plugin has been made so that all enchanted tools will remain taking damage even if the player has the no tool damage permission node! 
- Specific enchantments such as fortune may be individually detected in future version instead of the entire range of enchantments.
- Future versions will have the ability to reload the configuration file without needing to use the /reload command.
